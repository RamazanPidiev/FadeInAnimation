# FadeInAnimation
Fade in animation tutorial by using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

!!! Tutorial idea came from "https://fireship.io/". !!!

!!! If the animation doesn't play, try putting the <script> tag in your <body> instead of the <head>. !!!

You can always edit the animation, you don't have to do a fade in.
if you want the text to jump in from the right use "transform: translateX();".
Just play around with it and you'll get the idea.

Enjoy!
